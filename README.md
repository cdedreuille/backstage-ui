# üèóÔ∏è Backstage UI Experiment

This project is intended as an experiment to find the best structure for Backstage open source UI library. There is no plan for now to bring this back to Backstage in its current for nor to publish this library directly.

# Storybook

This repo is using React + Vite and we are using Storybook to test out the different components.

To run Storybook, launch this command:

`npm run storybook`

# Test 1

This version is using MUI System + Base UI. While this version is working well, this is not aligned with MUI's vision to remove MUI system.

# Test 2

In this new version we are exploring how to leverage Emotion theming system directly and Base UI.

# Test 3

Since future versions of MUI will be quite a departure from the current theming system, we are exploring how to build a unique theming system based 100% on CSS variables.
