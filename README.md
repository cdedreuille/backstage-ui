# 🏗️ Backstage UI Experiment

This project is intended as an experiment to find the best structure for Backstage open source UI library. There is no plan for now to bring this back to Backstage in its current for nor to publish this library directly.

# Storybook

This repo is using React + Vite and we are using Storybook to test out the different components.

To run Storybook, launch this command:

`npm run storybook`
